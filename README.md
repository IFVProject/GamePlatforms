# GamePlatforms
  This is an academic project for **Introduction to Information Visualization CIS-3755 Spring 2025** at Temple University.

  A simple web app that contains several visualizations helping gamers decide which PC Game platform is best for them by comparing potential benefits and reducing future costs. All visualizations are created using the JS d3 library.

  You can access our web app with this link https://ifvproject.github.io/GamePlatforms/ 

  Some lessons we learned:
    Scrolling too fast can break interactions.
    Formatting is everything. If you mess up one little thing with your height, width, etc. the graph silently fails with no warnings.
    Data typing really matters.
    D3 is a lot of fun when once you get the hang of it.
