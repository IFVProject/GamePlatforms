                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game platforms are digital distribution services where players can purchase, download, and launch games. 
                These platforms often provide additional services such as multiplayer matchmaking, game updates, achievements, social features, and digital rights management (DRM).
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this analysis, we are focusing on these three major PC game platforms
                    <li>Steam is the largest and most established platform, known for its vast library, community features, and frequent sales.</li>
                    <li>Epic Games Store is a newer competitor that differentiates itself with exclusive titles and free weekly game offerings.</li>
                    <li>Xbox Games on PC refers to Microsoft's presence in PC gaming offering access to a wide range of games for a subscription fee.</li>
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By comparing potential benefits and reducing future costs, gamers can decide which Game platform to purchase a new game from

                <h2>Popular Games</h2>
                <p>Often, games are judged by their visibility. Games that have great marketing seem to be much more impactpactful
                    than they actually are. This graph showcases the sales of some of the most popular games as well as their impact as they age.

            <div id="div2">
                <h2>Community Size</h2>
                <h3>Monthly Active Users (MAU)</h3>
                <p>Overall, Steam has the largest scale with the most monthly active users. 
                        Epic Games ranks second, and Xbox comes last.</p>
                <li>Better Multiplayer Experience</li>
                <li>More User-Generated Content</li>
                <li>Attracts More Developers => More games in the future</li>
                <h3>User base growth</h3>
                <p>Surprisingly, the annual user growth numbers are similar across the three platforms.</p>
                <p>But given Steam's large scale, Epic Games and Xbox have better user growth potential because they could have a higher percentage increase.</p>

                <h2>Future Cost Savings</h2>
                <li>The number of games on sale in the 2022 summer sales event.</li>
                <li>The number of free games offerred in 2022.</li>
                <h3>Steam</h3>
                <p>Steam also has the largest sales volume, offering the highest number of games on discount.
                     However, it rarely gives away games for free.</p>
                <h3>Epic Games</h3>
                <p>Epic games is well known for its <b>FreeGames</b> Strategy, and therefore it has the most free games offered by far.</p>
                <button id="switch">Free Games</button>
                <h3>Xbox Games</h3>
                <p>Due to Xbox's subscription fee, it has the lowest number of games on sale and lowest new game offering.
                    However, its Game Pass with the subscription fee can let gamers play hundreds of games with a low instant cost.</p>
